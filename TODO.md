# TODO

- [ ] Specify spark version in bundle itself (do not hardcode it)
- [ ] Feature to be able to launch script both locally and in cluster (even if cluster settings are to be set manually)
- [ ] for local execution, handle the fact that the versions used by the user are/are not the same as the one used to test the script
    - e.g. parameter to have warning or failure in case of wrong versions
